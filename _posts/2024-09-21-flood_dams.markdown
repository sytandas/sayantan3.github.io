The current flood situation in Panskura, a small town in the Purba Medinipur district of West Bengal, has made me reflect on why this is happening during my lifetime. I began to wonder about the root cause of this recurring issue. A simple Google search and reading a few research papers opened my eyes to the reality: unprofessional planning and overestimations are costing people their property, money, and even lives, every year, across India.

What are dams and reservoirs primarily designed for?
Irrigation – To ensure farmers have sufficient water to grow food for billions of people in India.
Flood Protection – To regulate rainwater and reduce the risk of floods.
Power Generation – To provide electricity, which is a crucial resource.
Navigation – To improve transportation efficiency and reduce costs.

But how successful have they been?
The reality is shocking.

The Cause of Failure:
LIES.

How?
The promises and capacities on paper are little more than falsehoods or, at best, a poor understanding of sedimentation science. The siltation rates are underestimated, and the live storage capacity is grossly overestimated.
Research papers show widespread failure of dams in key areas:
Irrigation – Inadequate water for food production.
Flood Safety – Dams fail to prevent flooding.
Power Generation – The actual electricity generated falls short of the promised capacity (even if not on paper).

Reasons:
Silt Accumulation: Several studies reveal that, in reality, reservoir capacity is significantly reduced by silt, far below the official figures.
Lifespan Misrepresentation: Many dams have technically "died" yet continue to function. Their longevity is exaggerated.
Sudden Water Release: These dams often can't hold enough water and release it abruptly, causing annual floods in many parts of India.
