# Strange article from a previouly non-athletic person who love running for now (from 2023).

**Someone ask me what is the point of this hard-work, sweat, early morning waking up, feeling tired?**

I replyed running is about much more than just the race or an exercise. 
It is about discipline, self-mastery and pushing past the limits you once thought were impossible.
Waking up early, working hard, training consistently—all of that is a reflection of the drive to grow, to become stronger mentally and physically. 
Every km is a step toward self-discovery. 
The real reward isn't in the money, or become more fit, but in the resilience you build,
the peace you find, and the joy of knowing that every day you're becoming a better version of yourself.
Running teaches patience, persistence, and humility—it mirrors life itself.
The race may end, but the growth stays with you forever. And that is priceless.

`Training:
Run for fun; Recreational/hobby, fun for time goal; professional/elite:
`

`Shoes:
Do not ignore it; you really need good pair(s), it helps long term.
Maybe only downside of running for some, more run = more shoes, shhh maybe it rewarding. 
Bare minimum requirement: 
If mileage > 35km/week better to have 2 pair of proper trainers. 
Race shoe for racing if affordablity have no issue. 
Always try to buy on discount (I never bought any running shoes at full price).
Fact: You can go with 1-2 years old model, toatally fine with that for trainers. 
E.g. Year 2024 Nike Pegasus 41 launched, you can buy Nike Pegausus 39-40 from 2022-23.  

Apparels: Less is more for running. Comfortability is crucial lightweight, moisture wicking fabric.

Some markup for training:
1. Simplified trining - just do it, most of us not lucky enough we have more things to do other than running.
2. Run as mileage
3. Obsession of consistency 
4. Do low impact as much as possible - gradual increase start slow
5. Eat more carb, protein, and water electrolyte so on so forth. 
6. Mentality to keep going, believe own self (do not need to take unnecessary pressure)
7. Try to keep the form (awareness of it from first to finish)
Will be elaborate and update in future.
